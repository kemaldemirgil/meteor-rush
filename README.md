## Meteor Rush

### About:
This is the first game I've created using https://scratch.mit.edu/ as my pre-work assignment for the bootcamp however, I unfortunately have to give a break to it for now.
I really enjoyed crafting it and I'm really impressed with the features `Scratch` can perform. I will continue to improve it over time...
